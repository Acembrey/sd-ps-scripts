Scripts I have created while working Service Desk

# Disclaimer 
In case anyone ever sees this repository, I just wanted a location to store all of my scripts to either reference back to or share in the future. Hopefully some of my scripts could prove useful to aspiring IT professionals, and I intend to create more repository as I grow in my career. 

I have modified most of scripts to mask the internal network information, so you may need to alter some scripts to accomodate your specific network needs.
